           <h3><p>The Telangana government has called for tenders to build its own ‘Times Square’ in Hyderabad.  Christened  ‘T-Square’, 
            the public space coming up at Raidurgam in Hi-Tech City will be a place of communication where people can congregate freely throughout
             the day to unwind after the daily grind. The open plaza will accommodate various events to celebrate the local spirit,
             ranging from impromptu concerts to organised events.</h3></p>
          <h3><P>Cyberabad houses more than 100 large IT/ITeS and BFSI companies, and employs nearly one million people. The Hyderabad Knowledge 
            City developed at Raidurgam is a new feather in the cap of this bustling area. Even though there are constant infrastructural upgrades to the area, it has been found that there is a lack of communal space for the burgeoning young population residing there. In order to provide a more engaging environment to the residents there,
             the Telangana Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TGIIC) has initiated a project that will embody the spirit of Cyberabad</h3></P>
           <h3><p>TGIIC is the nodal agency responsible for planning, development and maintenance of industrial infrastructure
             and allied facilities across the state. For this project, the TGIIC has invited consultancy proposal for architectural and 
             transaction advisory services for development of T-Square at Raidurgam. The corporation has stated that its aim is to develop this 
             intersection as a major tourist destination with vibrant urban spaces and entertainment hub. It will be a collaboration zone and commercial intersection to bring people together.</H3></P>
